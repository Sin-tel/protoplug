* consonants

p/t/k: 15ms burst, 40-80ms VOT
b/d/g: 15ms burst, zero VOT
- shape: add mild constriction, resolves almost immediately
- synthesize seperately (should it even pass through tract?)

s: enveloped noise 110ms total, 120ms VOT (no overlap)
z: somewhat shorter 80ms total, 50ms VOT
ts: stronger initial attack, 80ms total, 70ms VOT
sh: different filter, 90ms total
dz: 60 ms total, mild palatalization
- synthesize seperately

h: 50ms VOT, 100ms total
f: same, different filter
- both flat envelope

* glides/semivowels

r/l: 30ms fixed semivowel, 50ms glide 

y: i glide 40ms static, 70ms glide
palatalization: i glide 70ms

w: 30ms static, 60ms glide

n: 60ms static, 30ms glide
m: 60ms static, almost no glide


make some kind of frame system, 10ms hop size?
